# Please test the program’s parsing and rendering behavior when processing the complete CommonMark specification file.
# Requirements:
# - Read the full content of `spec.md`;
# - Render it into HTML using the CommonMark configuration;
# - Compare the rendered result with the full content of `test_file.html`;
# - This test can serve as an overall regression test for the parsing and rendering functionality.
def test_file():


# Please test the program’s parsing and rendering behavior against the official CommonMark specification examples.
# Requirements:
# - Read the collection of test cases from `commonmark.json`;
# - For each test case, extract the Markdown input and its corresponding expected HTML output;
# - Render the Markdown input using the CommonMark configuration provided by the project;
# - Compare the actual rendering result with the expected HTML output;
# - You may use parameterized tests to organize these test cases.
def test_spec():

# Please test the behavior of inserting a custom rule into the Core rule chain using core.ruler.after().
# Requirements:
# - Define a custom Core rule function. This function should take a `state` parameter and be used to mark that “the rule has been executed”, for example by printing a fixed string;
# - Define a plugin function, and in the plugin, insert the custom rule after the `normalize` rule;
# - Create a `MarkdownIt` instance and register the plugin using `.use()`;
# - Call `.parse()` with a simple Markdown input to trigger the execution of the Core rule chain;
# - Verify that the custom rule is actually called.

# Please test the program’s behavior when processing a non-existent file path.
# Requirements:
# - Provide a non-existent file path as input;
# - Verify that the program raises `SystemExit`;
# - Verify that the exit code is the abnormal exit code.
def test_parse_fail():

# Please test the program’s behavior when processing a Markdown file that is not encoded in UTF-8.
# Requirements:
# - Construct or provide a non-UTF-8 encoded Markdown file;
# - Invoke the command-line parsing functionality to process the file;
# - Verify that the program can handle the input;
# - Verify that the program exits normally with the normal exit code.
